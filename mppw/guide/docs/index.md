# Material Process-Property Warehouse (MPPW)

The MPPW is a web-based data platform intended to be used for planning, organization, storage, and analysis of manufacturing processes and material science experiments.  Processes and experiments are stored as highly configurable "digital threads" of simulation and physical results, allowing material property or other experimental results to be linked back to build process data.

In addition, a digital thread is a powerful planning abstraction for manufacturing, allowing manufacturing operations and experiments to be fully defined before real-world actions begin.

The [tutorial section](./tutorial/create_a_project.md) has an overview of how to set up a new project in the MPPW.
