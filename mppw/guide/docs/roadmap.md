# Roadmap

Major future inititives are listed here:

* Support for wider variety of `:file-bucket` and `:database-bucket` backends, as well as supporting `:time-series` and `:point-cloud` implementations.  In particular, ROSBags, Azure/S3/MinIO, and Kafka are current targets.

* Support for more streamlined sensor data collection interfaces, allowing specification of data collection needs in the data warehouse which can then be queried by sensor data collection platforms.

* Support for further data analysis integrations, allowing for customized analysis "buttons" for particular operation types that delegate to researcher-built JupyterHub-hosted scripts.
